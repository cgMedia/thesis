\chapter{\label{ch:conclusions}Conclusions and future perspective}

\dropcap{T}{his} thesis serves three main purposes.
First, it introduces the concept of \emph{active media}---physical systems governed by ordinary differential equations that couple together via radiative processes---and motivates the difficulty in examining these systems at a macroscopic or continuum level.
Second, it provides a discussion of numerical solution strategies based around time-domain integral equations.
Finally, it introduces and details the \QuEST{} software package.
This chapter summarizes the main findings of each of these parts and offers some perspective on potential research based on these ideas.

The Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation,
\begin{equation}
  \dv{\vb{M}}{t} = -\gamma_0 \vb{M} \cp \qty(\vb{H} - \eta \dv{\vb{M}}{t}),
  \label{eq:llg}
\end{equation}
details the evolution of magnetization, $\vb{M}$, in response to an applied magnetic field, $\vb{H}$~\cite{Aharoni2000}.
Here, $\gamma_0$ denotes the gyromagnetic ratio
\begin{equation}
  \gamma_0 = \frac{g \abs{e}}{2 m_e c},
  \label{eq:gyro}
\end{equation}
$\eta$ represents a phenomenological decay constant, and $g$, $e$, $m_e$, \& $c$ stand for the Land\'e $g$-factor, elementary charge, electron mass, and speed of light, respectively.
Immediately, \cref{eq:llg} draws a large number of parallels with the material equation of  \cref{ch:quantum dots}.
Apart from the obvious first-order and vector nature of both equations, the dual nature of electromagnetism means that $\vb{M}$ (as a source in Maxwell's equations) relates to $\vb{H}$ in the exact same way that $\vb{P}$ relates to $\vb{E}$.
By simply exchanging some of the physical constants, then, \cref{eq:integral operator} also describes radiation eminating from a magnetization distribution~\cite{Rothwell2009}.

Solving \cref{eq:llg} within a semiclassical radiaton framework requires a little more care than an equivalent Bloch problem, however.
\Cref{eq:liouville} describes the evolution of a quantum wavefunction---a vector in ``Bloch space''---that generates an electromagnetic source distribution through application of an operator (see the discussion surrounding \cref{eq:qd operators,eq:polarization definition} for an illustration of this point).
As a result, the dynamics of \cref{eq:liouville} describe the evolution of a dipole's amplitude but not its orientation and we may employ separate spatial and temporal discretizations to effect a numerical analysis.
Moreover, this allow for systems with zero intial polarization ($\vb{P} = 0$ in an eigenstate of the unperturbed Hamiltonian, e.g. $\hat{\rho} = \op{0}{0}$ or $\hat{\rho} = \op{1}{1}$), thus the external pulse induces all of the dynamical behavior.
This makes for a far easier simulation as sources/fields before the start of the simulation do not require any specification.

On the other hand, \cref{eq:llg} detremines the trajectory of an electromagnetic source vector in both (real, Cartesian, directional) space and time with no ability to decouple the dimensions beyond
\begin{equation}
  \vb{M}(t) = m_x(t) \vu{x} + m_y(t) \vu{y} + m_z(t) \vu{z}.
\end{equation}
As \QuEST{} accommodates histories of any type (scalar or tensor, real or complex) through careful templating, building a propagator for \cref{eq:llg} does not presnt much difficulty aside from some extra index tracking.
\Cref{eq:llg} also has an implicit normalization condition, however, in that
\begin{equation}
  \dv{\abs{\vb{M}}}{t} = 0.
\end{equation}
This presents a larger computational challenge as it implies particles/magnetic domains/``spins'' always interact---even before the start of a simulation in a manner not dissimlar to molecular dynamics simulations.
The mechanism behind the predictor/corrector algorithm---updating a source distribution and then reincorporating that into the electromagnetic fields before advancing the timestep---will accommodate these interactions without issue but meaningful simulations will require an equilbiration period of order $\mathcal{O}(r_\text{max}/c)$ before collecting data.

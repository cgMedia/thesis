Rabi oscillations typify the inherent nonlinearity of optical excitations in \qds{}.
Using an integral kernel formulation to solve the 3D Maxwell-Bloch equations in ensembles of up to $10^4$ quantum dots, we observe features in Rabi oscillations due to the interplay of nonlinearity, non-equilibrium excitation, and electromagnetic coupling between the dots.
This approach allows us to observe the dynamics of each dot in the ensemble without resorting to spatial averages.
Our simulations predict synchronized multiplets of dots that exchange energy, dots that dynamically couple to screen the effect of incident external radiation, localization of the polarization due to randomness and interactions, as well as wavelength-scale regions of enhanced and suppressed polarization.

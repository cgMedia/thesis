This model is basedon the Maxwell--Bloch equations with \$c\$-number stochastic noise terms. We successfullyapply our method to a numerical simulation of the atomic superfluorescenceprocess. This method opens the door to further studies of the effects of stochasticnoise on light-matter interaction and transient processes in complex systemswithout prior knowledge of modes.},

  Abstract                 = {Time-dependent model is presented to simulate random lasers in the presence of an inhomogeneous gain medium. PbSe quantum dots (QDs) with an arbitrary size distribution are treated as an inhomogeneous gain medium. By introducing inhomogeneity of the PbSe QDs in polarization, rate, and Maxwell\&\#x2019;s equations, our model is constructed for a one-dimensional disordered system. By employing the finite difference time-domain method, the governing equations are numerically solved and lasing spectra and spatial distribution of the electric field are calculated. The effect of increasing the pumping rate on the laser characteristics is investigated. The results show that the number of lasing modes and their intensities increase with pumping rate. It is also demonstrated that the emission spectra depend on the standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution function. Increasing the standard deviation leads to reduction of the laser intensity.},

  Abstract                 = {We introduce a new class of predictor-corrector schemes for the numerical solution of the Cauchy problem for non-stiff ordinary differential equations (ODEs), obtained via the decomposition of the solutions into combinations of appropriately chosen exponentials; historically, such techniques have been known as exponentially fitted methods. The proposed algorithms differ from the classical ones both in the selection of exponentials and in the design of the quadrature formulae used by the predictor-corrector process. The resulting schemes have the advantage of significantly faster convergence, given fixed lengths of predictor and corrector vectors. The performance of the approach is illustrated via a number of numerical examples.},

  Abstract                 = {A theory of the nonlinear interaction between a single quantum dot (QD) and electromagnetic fields, accounting the QD-depolarization (local-field) has been developed. QD excitation by classical and quantum electromagnetic fields such as coherent state of light, Fock qubit and gaussian excitation has been considered. As a result, for the case of the QD illuminated by coherent states of light, we predict the appearance of two oscillatory regimes in the Rabi oscillations. In the first one, signatures of Rabi oscillations are found to be suppressed: the population inversion is negative and the conventional collapse-revivals phenomenon is absent, while in the second one the collapse and revivals are appeared, showing significant difference as compared to those predicted within the standard Jaynes-Cummins theory. Under the pulsed excitation, Rabi oscillation dynamics is found to be strongly depended on the input pulse area and duration.},

  Abstract                 = {We demonstrate coherent random lasing from an aerosol of dye-doped microdroplets in air. The aerosol is in the form of a linear array of polydisperse, arbitrarily shaped, and randomly spaced microdroplets with average dimensions of about 30 $\mu$m. Upon optical excitation, ultranarrow lasing modes were observed in the emission along the axis of the linear array, while the transverse emission exhibited intrascatterer resonance peaks. Direct spatiospectral imaging and lasing threshold studies confirmed the origin of the lasing peaks to be from spatial modes that extended over the array of the polydisperse microdroplets.},

  Abstract                 = {Unlike conventional lasers, diffusive random lasers (DRLs) have no resonator to trap light and no high-Q resonances to support lasing. Because of this lack of sharp resonances, the DRL has presented a challenge to conventional laser theory. We present a theory able to treat the DRL rigorously and provide results on the lasing spectra, internal fields, and output intensities of DRLs. Typically DRLs are highly multimode lasers, emitting light at a number of wavelengths. We show that the modal interactions through the gain medium in such lasers are extremely strong and lead to a uniformly spaced frequency spectrum, in agreement with recent experimental observations.},

  Abstract                 = {We propose to produce three-dimensional ZnO random laser media on the basis of bulk ZnSe. Bulk ZnSe wafers are transformed into granular ZnO media by thermal treatment in oxygen ambient at temperatures in the range of 700–800 °C. This technology ensures a high optical quality of the ZnO nanostructured material produced to act as a gain medium for stimulated emission in the ultraviolet spectral region in combination with high-quality factor random laser resonators indicated by narrow lasing peaks. The quality factor for the observed emission modes is estimated to be around 1500. The structures produced are expected to find applications in microlaser technologies for optoelectronics and photonics.},

  Abstract                 = {Macroscopic ensembles of radiating dipoles are ubiquitous in the physical and natural sciences. In the classical limit the dipoles can be described as damped-driven oscillators, which are able to spontaneously synchronize and collectively lock their phases in the presence of nonlinear coupling. Here we investigate the corresponding phenomenon with arrays of quantized two-level systems coupled via long-range and anisotropic dipolar interactions. Our calculations demonstrate that by incoherently driving dense packed arrays of strongly interacting dipoles, the dipoles can overcome the decoherence induced by quantum fluctuations and inhomogeneous coupling and reach a synchronized steady-state characterized by a macroscopic phase coherence. This steady-state bears much similarity to that observed in classical systems, and yet also exhibits genuine quantum properties such as quantum correlations and quantum phase diffusion (reminiscent of lasing). Our predictions could be relevant for the development of better atomic clocks and a variety of noise tolerant quantum devices.},

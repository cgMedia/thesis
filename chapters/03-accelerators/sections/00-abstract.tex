\section{Abstract}

\dropcap{T}he Maxwell-Bloch algorithm of \cref{ch:quantum dots} scales poorly for large numbers of quantum dots due to an implicit $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ spatial complexity in the propagation calculation (\cref{eq:zmatrix,eq:projections}).
As many physical systems have the same mathematical structure, numerous techniques exist to reduce the poor scaling of these convolutions with fully controllable error.
This chapter will explain this bottleneck, several acceleration schemes that one might use to alleviate it, and, why we feel one particular variety of accelerator works best.
Additionally, I will detail the mathematics of such an acceleration technique, offer a reference implementation online, and give physical results found through simulating extended systems.

In the latter case the straightforward formulation in terms of a single integral equation may give rise to difficulties of non-uniqueness; it is shown that uniqueness can be restored by deriving a second integral equation and suitably combining it with the first. Finally, an outline is given of methods for transforming the integral operators with strongly singular kernels which occur in the second equation.},

  Abstract                 = { Biomedical acoustics is rapidly evolving from a diagnostic modality into a therapeutic tool, and acoustic cavitation is often the common denominator in a wide range of new therapeutic applications. High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) waves generated outside the body can be used to deposit heat deep within the body. Through a quantitative analysis of heat deposition by ultrasound, it is shown that inertial cavitation can help address some of the major challenges of HIFU therapy by providing a means of enhancing and monitoring treatment noninvasively. In the context of drug delivery, both inertial and stable cavitation play roles in enhancing drug activity and uptake. In particular, shape oscillations arising during stable cavitation provide an effective micropumping mechanism for enhanced mass transport across inaccessible interfaces. },

In our approach{,} we use pairs of slanted-finger interdigital transducers (SFITs) to generate a tunable standing surface acoustic wave field{,} which in turn patterns microparticles or cells in one- or two-dimensional arrays inside the microfluidic channels-all without the assistance of fluidic flow. By tuning the frequency of the input signal applied to the SFITs{,} we have shown that the cell pattern can be controlled with tunability of up to 72%. This acoustic-based tunable patterning technique has the advantages of wide tunability{,} non-invasiveness{,} and ease of integration to lab-on-a-chip systems{,} and shall be valuable in many biological and colloidal studies.},

  Abstract                 = {Ultrasound contrast agents, in the form of gas-filled microbubbles, are becoming popular in perfusion monitoring; they are employed as molecular imaging agents. Microbubbles are manufactured from biocompatible materials, they can be injected intravenously, and some are approved for clinical use. Microbubbles can be destroyed by ultrasound irradiation. This destruction phenomenon can be applied to targeted drug delivery and enhancement of drug action. The ultrasonic field can be focused at the target tissues and organs; thus, selectivity of the treatment can be improved, reducing undesirable side effects. Microbubbles enhance ultrasound energy deposition in the tissues and serve as cavitation nuclei, increasing intracellular drug delivery. \{DNA\} delivery and successful tissue transfection are observed in the areas of the body where ultrasound is applied after intravascular administration of microbubbles and plasmid DNA. Accelerated blood clot dissolution in the areas of insonation by cooperative action of thrombolytic agents and microbubbles is demonstrated in several clinical trials. },

  Abstract                 = {Contrast agent microshells (CAMSs) are under intensive investigation for their wide applications in biomedical imaging and drug delivery. In drug delivery applications, \{CAMSs\} are guided to the targeted site before fragmentation by high-intensity ultrasound waves leading to the drug release. Prediction of the acoustic radiation force used to nondestructively guide a \{CAMS\} to the suspected site is becoming increasingly important and gaining attention particularly because it increases the system efficiency. The goal of this work is to present a theoretical model for the time-averaged (static) acoustic radiation force experienced by a \{CAMS\} near a blood vessel wall. An exact solution for the scattering of normal incident plane acoustic waves on an air-filled elastic spherical shell immersed in a nonviscous fluid near a porous and nonrigid boundary is employed to evaluate the radiation force function (which is the radiation force per unit energy density per unit cross-sectional surface). A particular example is chosen to illustrate the behavior of the time-averaged (static) radiation force on an elastic polyethylene spherical shell near a porous wall, with particular emphasis on the relative thickness of the shell and the distance from its center to the wall. This proposed model allows obtaining a priori information on the static radiation force that may be used to advantage in related as drug delivery and contrast agent imaging. This study should assist in the development of improved models for the evaluation of the time-averaged acoustic radiation force on a cluster of \{CAMSs\} in viscous and heat-conducting fluids.

Experimental observations are reported that provide some characteristics of the phenomenon, such as bubble distributions and sound–field measurements. A discussion of relevant physical interactions in bubbly liquids is comprised of wave dynamics, Bjerknes and drag forces, nucleation and coalescence. For describing the structure formation process, continuum and particle approaches are employed. In the framework of the continuum model it is shown that homogeneous bubble distributions are unstable, and regions with high bubble concentration emerge in the course of a self–concentration process. In the particle model, all bubbles are treated as interacting objects that move in the liquid. This approach is complementary to the continuum model. It allows the inclusion of some particular features, for instance Bjerknes forces based on nonlinear bubble oscillations. Both models are discussed and results are compared with experimentally observed patterns.},

  Abstract                 = {The propagation of ultrasound through a liquid induces the growth of inceptions and germs into bubbles. In a low frequency reactor, fragmentary transient bubbles emerge due to the acoustic driving. They violently collapse in one cycle and fragment into many smaller bubbles than in turn cavitate. This violent collapse is responsible for the mechanical effects of ultrasounds effects. The latter bubbles gather in a ball-shaped cloud and migrate to pressure antinodes. During their migration, their nonexplosive collapses mainly contribute to activate chemical reactions by producing OH• radicals. Mathematical modelling is performed as a new approach to predict the bubbles field. Through numerical simulation, we determinate emergence sites of mechanically active cavitation bubbles. Calculus are compared with aluminium foil degradation. The modelling of bubble migration allow us to have an insight on the privileged sites of the chemical reactions. Validation of the modelling is made through direct comparison with chemiluminescence photo. All experiments and computations are made in a 28.2 kHz sonoreactor. },

  Abstract                 = {In a dense discrete random medium, the propagation and scattering of waves are affected not only by the individual properties of the particles such as size, shape, and permittivity, but also by group properties such as the statistics of relative particle positions and relative orientations. We use Monte Carlo simulations to investigate the interactions of electromagnetic waves with a dense medium consisting of spheroidal particles for cases of random orientation and for cases of aligned orientation. A shuffling process is used to generate the positions of densely packed spheroids. Multiple-scattering equations are formulated by means of the volume integral equation and are solved numerically. The scattering results are averaged over realizations. Numerical results are presented for the extinction rates and the phase matrices. Salient features of the numerical results indicate that (1) the extinction rates of densely packed small spheroids are smaller than those of independent scattering; (2) for aligned spheroids, the extinction rates are polarization dependent; and (3) the co-polarized part of the phase matrix for densely packed spheroids is smaller than that of independent scattering, while the cross-polarized part is larger than that for independent scattering. This means that the ratio of cross-polarization to co-polarization is significantly higher than that of independent scattering.},

  Abstract                 = {A theoretical model accounting for bubble-bubble interaction is proposed for cavitation clouds produced during kidney stone treatment with shock wave lithotripsy (SWL). The associated bubble collapse contributes to stone comminution, but the cloud itself may reduce the effectiveness of subsequent shock wave pulses. Since the bubbles in the cloud are close to one another, their interactions can be important. Here we present a model and simulation for the growth, coalescence, and collapse of bubbles in a cluster near a rigid surface, subjected to a shock wave. Bubble translation due to Bjerknes forces is illustrated for the case of a single bubble near a rigid surface.},

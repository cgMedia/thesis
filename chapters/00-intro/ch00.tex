\dropcap{A}{s} our ability to resolve physical systems grows, so, too, do our demands of the models we build.
Unfortunately, we rapidly approach an age where approximate analytic descriptions of the universe simply cannot recover important features in systems of interest.
Substituting \emph{numerical} approximations into higher resolution models alleviates this problem somewhat (particularly as the hardware evolves ``below'' the model), though the computational overhead of \naive\ algorithms almost certainly limits their utility.
The computational scientist, then, has a tricky job: design algorithms that exploit properties of the systems under investigation to provide

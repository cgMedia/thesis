\begin{enumerate}

  \item
  \item ``Faster mathematics'' plays a much larger role than ``more physics'' in computer models' ongoing march towards realism.
  \item The addition of clever damping terms describing rigid bodies in potential flow eliminates numerical problems arising from unconventional equations of motion of the form $\ddot{x} = f(t, x, \dot{x}, \ddot{x})$.
  \item 
  \item
  \item In balancing safety, efficiency, and ease-of-use, mainstream programming languages have a useful lifespan of very nearly 20 years.
  \item Building a ``computer'' with enough sophistication to rival a mamalian brain will require henceforth unexplored hardware architectures, likely based on physical manifestiations of constructs in graph theory.
  \item Use of the passive voice in technical writing stands in direct and terrifying opposition to clear, unbiased communication. Authors wishing to maximize understanding should eliminate every instance of ``to be'' (and its conjugations) from their manuscripts with extreme prejudice.
  \item
  \item Since the advent of the printing press, no other tool comes close to the power of a wiki for the collection, categorization, and dissemination of human knowledge.

  Supervisors Dr.\ Carlo Piermarocchi and Dr.\ Balasubramaniam Shanker formally
  regard these propositions as opposable and defendable and have approved them
  as such to accompany a doctoral dissertation defense.
